    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Of Loki's three monstrous children, the most fearsome is of course 
        Fenrir. The great wolf Fenrir has been kept contained by the gods
        themselves, but a permanent solution must be found. The god's 
        have tried all manner of rope and chain to control Fenrir, but 
        to no avail. The only solution is the chain <em>Gleipnir</em>, a 
        chain made solely of things which do not exist and so are useless 
        to struggle against.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A spare hand</li>
        <li>Various lessser chains</li>
        <li>Assistance from the dwarves</li>
        <li>Sound from a cat's footsteps</li>
        <li>Roots from a mountain</li>
        <li>A woman's beard</li>
        <li>Spittle from a bird</li>
        <li>The breath of a fish</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>

        <li>Ask the dwarves to make the greatest chain ever wrought</li>
        <li>Approach Fenrir and offer him a contest to prove his strength</li>
        <li>Offer to wrap him in chains, for him to break out and prove himself</li>
        <li>Wrap Fenrir in chains from weakest to strongest</li>
        <li>When he breaks out of each chain, cheer as though this was intended</li>
